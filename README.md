# 🌍 Global Patterns of Dietary Microplastic Ingestion (1990–2018)

This project explores how **dietary microplastic ingestion** has evolved globally from 1990 to 2018 using **unsupervised machine learning** techniques.

We analyzed international datasets and applied clustering algorithms to uncover hidden patterns, regional trends, and structural shifts in microplastic exposure through food consumption.

## 🔍 Analytical Approach

We implemented and compared **Hierarchical Clustering**, **K-Means**, and **DBSCAN** across different time windows to:

* Identify clusters of countries with similar microplastic ingestion profiles
* Track the **evolution** of clusters to detect shifts, transitions, and stability over time
* Investigate **geographic variability** and the regional concentration of ingestion patterns

## ❓ Research Questions

* Has microplastic ingestion increased globally over time?
* Are there significant **regional differences** in ingestion trends?
* How do clusters evolve across decades — do we observe **stability**, **turnover**, or **emerging dynamics**?
